/**
 * CreateRoom Component - This component is responsible for creating or joining a game room.
 *
 * Basic Flow:
 * 1. **Props**:
 *    - `changeState`: A function passed as a prop to close the modal when the user is done.
 *    - `title`: A string that determines whether the component is in "Create Room" or "Join Room" mode.
 *    - `socket`: A socket instance used to communicate with the backend server for room creation and joining.
 *
 * 2. **Component Setup**:
 *    - `useRef` is used to keep references to the room name input field (`inputRef`) and the tile number select dropdown (`tileRef`).
 *    - `useState` is used to manage component state:
 *      - `admin`: A boolean state that determines if the current user is the admin (creator) of the room.
 *      - `waitingForPlayer`: A new state used to display a message when the room is created, and the system is waiting for another player to join.
 *
 * 3. **Event Handling**:
 *    - **Create Room**:
 *      - The `handleCreate` function is triggered when the user clicks the "Create Room" button.
 *      - It checks if the room name is provided. If not, an alert is shown.
 *      - If the room name is valid, it emits a `createRoom` event to the backend with the room name and sets the current user as the admin.
 *      - The `waitingForPlayer` state is set to `true` to show a waiting message while the room is waiting for the second player to join.
 *
 *    - **Join Room**:
 *      - The `handleJoin` function is triggered when the user clicks the "Join Room" button.
 *      - It checks if the room name is provided. If not, an alert is shown.
 *      - If the room name is valid, it emits a `joinRoom` event to the backend to join the room.
 *      - The `admin` state is set to `false` since the user is joining an existing room.
 *
 * 4. **Socket Communication**:
 *    - The component listens for the `start game` event from the backend using `socket.on("start game")`.
 *    - When the `start game` event is received, the component checks if the current user is part of the game (either `player1` or `player2`).
 *    - If the user is part of the game, they are redirected to the room page using `navigate` with their `socket.id`, the `roomName`, and their admin status (either `0` or `12`).
 *    - The `socket.off("start game")` is used to clean up the event listener when the component is unmounted.
 *
 * 5. **UI Rendering**:
 *    - The component renders a modal with:
 *      - A room name input field to enter the name of the room.
 *      - A select dropdown for the number of tiles (only visible when the user is creating a room).
 *      - A "Waiting for player" message that is displayed when the room is created and waiting for the second player.
 *      - A button that changes its label to either "Create Room" or "Join Room" depending on the `title` prop.
 *
 * 6. **Navigation**:
 *    - Upon successful room creation or joining, the user is navigated to a new page for the game room using `navigate`.
 *    - The `navigate` method ensures that the user is redirected to the appropriate room page after the game starts.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If the user is creating a room, they can select the number of tiles (32, 64, or 128 tiles).
 * - If the user is joining a room, they simply need to input the room name and join.
 * - The `waitingForPlayer` state controls whether the component shows the message "Waiting for the other player to join..." or not.
